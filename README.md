# Data Engineering Bootcamp - Google Africa

In this repository, you will find the folder of each session to follow the examples and exercises used during class and a guide for the structure of your Capstone Project.

Remember that extra resources and the Capstone Project general instructions are on Google Classroom. 

   

**Important notes**
- Schedule your 1:1 session with your assigned mentor to review the exercises and implementations shown during live sessions.
- Work on your capstone project as soon as we review the sessions and use your mentoring time to review your progress and make the necessary changes.
